# Plutus Pioneer Program

This is the official Plutus pioneer program repository from IOHK.
Instead of providing links to lectures a book is added to this repository:

Plutus - Learning a smart contract language

The book has the same structure as the lectures which can be found at IOHK page:
https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program

In addition the oracle and uniswap examples are also added to the code and the
book, which were presented in the 2nd iteration of the pioneer programm.

I prepared the book taking most of the contect directly from the lectures and
added some additional contect for toppics I felt needed more insight.
